The purpose of this repository is to provide clear and concise examples of these machine learning models and demonstrate their usage 
for predictive modeling tasks. Each model implementation includes the necessary steps such as data preprocessing, model training, and
evaluation.

Model Descriptions:

Linear Regression: Linear Regression is a popular algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.
It fits a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable, enabling us to make predictions on unseen data.

Decision Tree: Decision Tree is a versatile algorithm that builds a tree-like model of decisions based on features to predict the target 
variable. It splits the data based on the most informative features, resulting in a hierarchical structure that aids in making predictions.

Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance.
It creates a collection of decision trees and aggregates their predictions to make final predictions. This technique reduces overfitting 
and improves generalization.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a powerful algorithm for both regression and classification tasks. It separates data points into 
different classes by constructing hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space. SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that maximally separates
the classes.
